// Question #2: Array Deduping
// Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.

// Example
// Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi", 7, 53]

// Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

// Questions: For strings does "hi" equal "Hi" or are those two distinct?

//declare the function
// declare duplicateArray
// declare empty array res, to store new array
// for loop where element is not equal to
