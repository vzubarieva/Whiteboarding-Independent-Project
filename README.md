# _Functional Programming with JavaScript_

#### By _**Viktoriia Zubarieva**_

## Description

I should be prepared for whiteboard interview session. 5 questions were included for student to study and develop solutions for.

This is a mock technical interview practice, so the goal is to practice as if you were interviewing for a real job. For both the interviewers (who are giving feedback) and interviewee (who is whiteboards), this means that you should be formal in your presentation:

Check to make sure folks can hear you, see your code.
Speak clearly, doing your best not to trail off in your speech or mumble.
Make eye contact.
Be polite and encouraging.
If the interviewee is stuck and you (the interviewer) know how to get unstuck:
Give the interviewee space to figure out next steps before offering help.
Ask the interviewee if they want help before giving help.
If you are doing this remotely, have your video turned on. If you are having a technical issue that makes it so you can't share your video, let your group members know.
